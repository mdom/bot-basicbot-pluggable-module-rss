NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::RSS - RSS feed aggregator for your bot

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        !load RSS
        rss add http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf
        rss list
        rss remove http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables your bot to monitor various RSS feeds for new
    headlines and post these to your channels. Every channel has it's own
    list of rss feeds, but in case two channels subscribed to the same rss
    feeds, it's only checked once and the bot posts changes to both
    channels. Although this module does not block your bot due the
    non-blocking interface of POE::Component::RSSAggregator, adding a lot of
    fast changing rss feeds will result in sluggish behaviour.

VARIABLES
  tmp
    Directory to keep a cached feed (using Storable) to keep persistance
    between instances. This defaults to the first writable directory from a
    list of possible temporary directories as provided by File::Spec.

  debug
    Turn debuging on console on. Off by default

  init_headlines_seen
    Mark all headlines as seen from the intial fetch, and only report new
    headlines that appear from that point forward. This defaults to true.

  delay
    Number of seconds between updates (defaults to 600).

LIMITATIONS
    In the moment this module is only able to parse rss feeds and will throw
    a lot of warnings at you when you try to add an atom feed as the
    underlying wokrhorse of POE::Component::RSSAggregator just support this
    one format.

TODO
    The testuite is almost not existing as i'm not yet sure how to reliable
    test POE code. I'll have to look into that.
